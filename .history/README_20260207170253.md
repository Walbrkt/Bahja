# AI Interior Architect

An AI-powered interior design app that transforms your room photos with furniture recommendations from IKEA and other retailers.

## Features

- 📷 **Image Upload**: Upload a photo of your room
- 💬 **Natural Language**: Describe what furniture you want to add ("add a grey sofa and round coffee table")
- 🎨 **AI Visualization**: Get an AI-generated image showing your room with the furniture
- 🛋️ **IKEA Integration**: Browse matching IKEA products with article numbers and direct buy links
- 🎯 **Smart Search**: Filter by style (scandinavian, modern, industrial, minimalist, classic) and budget

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- HTTP tunnel such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) if you want to test with remote MCP hosts like ChatGPT or Claude.ai.

### Local Development

#### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

#### 2. Start your local server

Run the development server from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This command starts:
- Your MCP server at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.
- Skybridge DevTools UI at `http://localhost:3000/`.
